        <h2> How did I get here? </h2>
        <p>
            Being raised in Tampa most of my life, I didn't consider moving to Orlando and
            attending UCF as a possibility. While I did get accepted during the application
            process, my first choice was USF due to money purposes. However, my brother wanted
            to go to UCF as a music major, and events leaded up to me following him and transferring
            to UCF.

        <h2> Decisions </h2>
        <p>
            I started UCF a little ahead in credits due to taking college courses in high school,
            I honestly didn't really know what I wanted to major in so I had less time to think
            about what to major in while I complete my general courses. Growing up using technology
            my whole life, I figured it would make sense to major in either IT or Computer Science,
            something that pays well and could be considered a stable career if I were to stick
            with it in the long run.

        <h2> IT/Computer Science </h2>
        <p>
           Graduating high school in 2020, I was apart of the many students who started their college
           journey online during COVID. Starting as an IT major, I thought the classes were a little
           tough, even as beginner coding classes, but having little coding experience, I thought it
           was pretty tough. I don't think having classes via Zoom helped a lot, as I couldn't learn
           too much. There was a sudden switch throughout this time period where I thought majoring in
           Computer Science rather than IT would be better for me in the future, so I decided to switch
           majors. This is when I was finally able to attend classes in-person, and while I did manage
           to get by as an IT major, I realized Computer Science is a lot more rigorous in terms of work
           load and decided it didn't fit my lifestyle nor click in general.

        <h2> Digital Media </h2>
        <p>
            Moving into 2022, I finally switched my major to Digital Media on the web design track. For
            context, I always loved to do anything related to design; doing some research, I found
            that interface design really interested me, so I decided to pursue this major instead. While
            I'm not too deep into the track, I definitely found that learning web design was more interesting
            and something I found enjoyable and satisfying.

        <h2> What's next </h2>
        <p>
             The journey so far has been a lot of ups and downs, I hoped to graduate within a certain time frame,
             but ultimately realized it's a lot better to take your time to find and learn something more
             enjoyable and can consider a career in the future. I'm hoping to stick through with the major
             and find an interface design job.
